### Short description

In few words this optimization problem is about computing way for lumberjack in a forest, which gives him the biggest profit. Trees are in different location on a grid, they have different parameters and what's worse - can fall on each other, so it is not so living forest. Nice problem, current solution is one of the simplest one, but it passed the tests.
